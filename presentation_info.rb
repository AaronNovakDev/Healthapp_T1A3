# Hello every one, my names Aaron. And welcome to my Daily Health App.



# I am creating this app so that its very easy to use, people of all ages and levels of education can learn it with ease.
# I would like every one to use this app so they can help themselves stay on track , basically with anything they see fit.
# Its not just for medications and vitamins, its a general all round health app that also doubles up basically like a personal assistant, so you never forget to take your supplements, vitamins, mineral etc daily, this is the app for you.




# I created the structure around the fact that a lot of people I talk to want to get healthy and stay healthy, but its very easy during youre busy day to just forget to take vitamins, minerals, greens powders, etc. What ever it is you already take, and want to keep taking and not forget.
# So it was structured around the monday to sunday pill boxes that many people use and take with them on a daily.


# The app i created is just for a person to input all there medical data they would like to remember and continue to pursue on a daily, but you can also add in anything else you would like to accomplish on a daily. Would you like to do 100 star jumps a day spred into twice a day, then you can add that into the array and hash, you can pull out that data any time you like. So its going to be very versitile once its completed. 



# Created with the use of several classes which iterate through the limited information I was able to create in the arrays and hashes, all you need to do is at the main menu to add, modify or delete an item is press on the menu item from 1 to 5 digits on a keyboard, then it will ask which item you would like to add to a user, replace a current item with another item for a user, or delete the users item if you for any reason dont want to do that item any more, its very easy to use with basic commands, such as "who is the user" "what is the item" and then you click either y or n to delete or replace.




# I also will put in a bonus tab for people that are going into meeting or studying so that they can acheive the most information to be absorbed via various methods of keeping yourself alert and in a great mind set for learning.
# Also a random array of fun facts that people may not know, ive always liked random facts and I think they would be beneficial to any and every one. Im going to make it sort of a guessing game if I can.

# Ok heres the nitty gritty, its just a small snippet on the code I have been working on over the last few weeks.
# It doesnt look like much and it was very easy to over look and just say ill do it later on in time, but when you really get into it, its very hard to make it all work the way you want it.
# Also the hardest parts for me was choosing which order to put it all in and which classes to even choose.
# I really over looked the fact how hard it is to put the data in the way you want it to work and had to change it litterally several times. I also even completely changed the whole app to make it much more doable.



# So as you can see, its just an app for every one to keep themselves happy and healthy. The healthier you are, the happier you are. 
# All the information is just guidelines and you can do with it as you wish.
# Each person has different brain chemistry so different dosing and vitamins / minerals work on different people, and I would highly suggest you visit your go to health person, whether its Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor, Averyvedic doctor, western medicine doctor, or other naturopaths.

# Ok so, ...yes, as you can see, this is what i wanted to the app to do in the first instance, but i quickly found out that wasnt very possible.


# SHOW THE APP.




# This tab  is just to say thanks to the stock images that are on the Microsoft power-point app. They made it extremely easy for me to find great high quality photos for this slide show to depict exactly what it is I would like to portray to every one.

# And thanks very much every one for your time, and I hope you enjoyed my presentation, if you have any questions, i will try and answer them.
