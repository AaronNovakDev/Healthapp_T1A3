*Design a Software Development Plan for a terminal application. The following requirements provide details of what needs to be included in this plan*

![flowchart](./flowchart_terminalapp.png)




**R5**

*Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:*

- *describe at a high level what the application will do.*

My application is going to start off its life as just a program that you sign in under youre name and then you add what medications and personal vitamins, minerals and other things that you would like to take on a daily and not forget. Eventually i want the app to add in more and more functions that will help you get healthy and stay healthy. It will also add in alternate options such as reflexology , essential oils and breathing techniques. It will also add in quick fixes like splashing freezing cold water on youre face, doing small excercises to wake yourself up quickly if your in meetings and feeling tired. I would eventually like to have it have pop up type messages on your phone so that you will never miss what ever it is you want to consume. For some people it may even be a reminder to eat, as some people say they always forget to eat and often set timers to remind them.



- *identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it.*

It will solve the problems that people always tell me they want to try and get healthy and but they never know what to take, and when to take it, and also tell you what you should take to feel better for increasing energy and cognitive power. Many people either dont know what to take, or when to take it and how much.
It is all just examples of course, as i dont want people to say that I told them to take what and when if they get sick ,etc. Every ones body is different after all, its just a guide through what ive learnt through-out my life. I will add as many studies as I can eventually as well.




- *identify the target audience.*

My target audience is every one that is trying to look after their health, and over my years i know a lot of people do want to try and look after their health but they seem to lack the knowledge and information to make them help them selves, so i am creating this app for any one that honestly does forget when to take supplements and vitamins, and it will let them know what they should take and when they should take it, its entirely up to them if they take it, they are only guidlines.
Of course you need to take vitamins etc for a while, so I will reccomend them to take them for a minimum of at least a week, but its entirely up to them on what i may suggest. The info they put in will be entirely up to them if they wish to choose, with what alergies or medical problems they have that may not allow them to take certain vitamins and minerals.



- *explain how a member of the target audience will use it.*

They will log in to the app with their name, initially they will enter in the items they want to add and the amount of times a day they take them. Eventually if they explore the app they find that there is a lot of valuable information on various items that I will put in the app. It will go through a loop style that will ask them what they want to add, how they are feeling, if they would like inforamtion on how they may be able to take something that might help them feel better.
If they choose that they are ok, the it will continue down to the main menu, which will tell them what they have and havent taken on that particular day.
Every day the counter will start back to 0, but the items wont dissapear.
It will have a guideline for supplements that I over time have studied and worked for my body chemistry.



**R6**

**Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:**
- *at least THREE features.*
- *describe EACH feature*


The 1st feature im going to encorperate in my program are going to be being able to add unlimited users, with each one having their own health history that they would add in, and then on top of that I would let them know some alternative ways to do what they would like to accomplish, it could be energy, better sleep, better cognition, etc.

The 2nd feature would be me asking them if they have had a big night or if they are feeling good. It would them give them a list of supplements to aid them through the day with what they desire. If they have had a big night it would ask you and it would give you a list of how what you might take to make you better.

The 3rd one i would have is a list of the supplements and their back ground of history of reasearch on why they work.
I will allow for an add, delete and replace of the item they wish to insert into the loop and then they can modify the amount of times they wish to take it a day.

I will add in error handling so that they cant enter in amount which is either too much or not enough. I will also add in the error of an incorrect name and then go back to add user if its been used before.


**Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:**
- *use of variables and the concept of variable scope*
- *loops and conditional control structures*
- *error handling*

Yes!



**R7**

**Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.**
*Your outline must include:*
- *how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature.*

The app will up ask you your name and let you enter in all the details you wish to enter.
Once you have enetered them  it all ask you how frequently you wish to take each item, and also how many times a day.
It would then ask you if you would like some further suggestions that have been studied over time that can aid in what you would like to acheive.


- *how the user will interact with / use each feature*

They will just need to click each button in the terminal app that they wish to explore. There will be a main menu that will show all the content, but it will also give you some suggested options. 

- *how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user*


The errors will be handled in a way that you cant enter in the wrong information or it will tell you that its not correct and ask you to try again and go back in the loop.


*Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:*

- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.

**R9**

- *Develop an implementation plan which:*
- *outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature*

Created on the trello board


- *prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature*



- *provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item*

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan - Yes - im useing a Trello Board.

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.








**R10**
Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application.

To install the application you wont require any additional software apart from having windows, linux or apple OS installed.
The item has been converted to a terminal application, so all you will need to do it double click it and it will open into a terminal app.
Most modern laptops and computers have some version of a terminal app installed on the standard operating system software.


- any dependencies required by the application to operate.

The will require Ruby to be installed.

- any system/hardware requirements

Minimum specs to run a command line app, are the most basic of computers.
A PC or Laptop > 2000.
A keyboard.

**R11 & R12**

Created and attached to the zip file.

**R13**

Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Ruby such as:
- variables and variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- write and utilise simple functions
- error handling
- input and output
- importing a Ruby Gem
- using functions from a Ruby Gem


**R14**
*Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.*

-Applied to the best of my abilities.

**R15**

*Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.*

-Applied to the best of knowledge, capabilities and abilities.

**R16**
*Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.*

- I will try my best!

**R17**
Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested

I will be testing the user to make sure they typed in the correct name when they are trying to edit or delete and item from the array.

The other ill be testing is the fact that the loop goes back once the delete array button has been done, it must go back to the main menu.


- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case





FROM VARSHA

Ask User for inputs   
1. User class - create user  user = User.new 
2. Supplement Schedule -- Class  def initialize(user})  end this class gets initialized once the user submits his / her schedule for taking in supplements 
Example Data:  Iron morning  Vit C twice a day Vit D shot once a week - every Saturday  
save schedule -- to a file  
update schedule   
delete schedule  
3. Suggestion -- Class  suggest supplements - depending on user schedule



User - input data, can save to file etc .
enter in medication / supplements and modify/delete/add
various - to 5 different things - sleep, study, relax, quick energy, bonus.
